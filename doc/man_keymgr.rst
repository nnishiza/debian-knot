keymgr -- DNSSEC key management utility
=======================================

Synopsis
--------

:program:`keymgr` [*global-options*] [*command*...] [*arguments*...]

:program:`keymgr` [*global-options*] [*command*...] **help**

Description
-----------

The :program:`keymgr` utility serves for DNSSEC keys and KASP (Key And
Signature Policy) management in Knot DNS server. The configuration is stored
in a so called KASP database. The database is simply a directory on the
file-system containing files in the JSON format.

The operations are organized into commands and subcommands. The command
specifies the operation to be performed with the KASP database. It is usually
followed by named arguments. A special command **help** can be used to list
available subcommands at that position. Listing of available command arguments
is not supported yet.

The command and argument names are parsed in a smart way. Only a beginning
of the name can be specified and will be recognized. The specified part must
be unique amongst the other names.

Global options
..............

**--dir** *path*
  The location of the KASP database to work with. Defaults to current working
  directory.

Main commands
.............

**init**
  Initialize new KASP database.

**zone** ...
  Operations with zones in the database. A zone holds assigned signing
  configuration and signing metadata.

**policy** ...
  Operations with KASP policies. The policy holds parameters that define the
  way how a zone is signed.

**keystore** ...
  Operations with private key store content. The private key store holds
  private key material separately from zone metadata.

zone commands
.............

**zone** **add** *zone-name* [**policy** *policy-name*\|\ **none**]
  Add a zone into the database. The policy defaults to **none**, meaning that
  no automatic key management is to be performed.

**zone** **list** [*pattern*]
  List zones in the database matching the *pattern* as a substring.

**zone** **remove** *zone-name* [**force**]
  Remove a zone from the database. If some keys are currently active, the
  **force** argument must be specified.

**zone** **set** *zone-name* [**policy** *policy-name*\|\ **none**]
  Change zone configuration. At the moment, only a policy can be changed.

**zone** **show** *zone-name*
  Show zone details.

**zone** **key** **list** *zone-name*
  List key IDs and tags of zone keys.

**zone** **key** **show** *zone-name* *key*
  Show zone key details. The *key* can be a key tag or a key ID prefix.

**zone** **key** **generate** *zone-name* [*key-parameter*...]
  Generate a new key for a zone.

**zone** **key** **import** *zone-name* *key-file*
  Import an existing key in the legacy format. The *key-file* suffix
  :file:`.private` or :file:`.key` is not required. A public key without
  a matching private key cannot be imported.

**zone** **key** **set** *zone-name* *key* [*key-parameter*...]
  Change a key parameter. Only key timing parameters can be changed.

Available *key-parameter*\ s:

  **algorithm** *id*
    Algorithm number or IANA mnemonic.

  **size** *bits*
    Size of the key in bits.

  **ksk**
    Set the DNSKEY SEP (Secure Entry Point) flag.

  **publish** *time*
    The time the key is publish as a DNSKEY record.

  **active** *time*
    The time the key is started to be used for signing.

  **retire** *time*
   The time the key is stopped to be used for signing.

  **remove** *time*
    The time the key's DNSKEY is removed from the zone.

The *time* accepts YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format, unix timestamp, or offset from the
current time. For the offset, add **+** or **-** prefix and optionally a
suffix **mi**, **h**, **d**, **w**, **mo**, or **y**. If no suffix is specified,
the offset is in seconds.

policy commands
...............

**policy** **list**
  List policies in the database.

**policy** **show** *policy-name*
  Show policy details.

**policy** **add** *policy-name* [*policy-parameter*...]
  Add a new policy into the database.

**policy** **set** *policy-name* [*policy-parameter*...]
  Change policy configuration.

**policy** **remove** *policy-name*
  Remove a policy from the database.
  **Note**, the utility does not check if the policy is used.

Available *policy-parameter*\ s:

  **algorithm** *id*
    DNSKEY algorithm number or IANA mnemonic.

  **dnskey-ttl** *seconds*
    TTL value for DNSKEY records.
    **Note**, the value is temporarily overridden by the SOA TTL.

  **ksk-size** *bits*
    Set size of the KSK in bits.

  **zsk-size** *bits*
    Set size of the ZSK in bits.

  **zsk-lifetime** *seconds*
    Interval after which the ZSK rollover will be initiated.

  **rrsig-lifetime** *seconds*
    Lifetime of issued RRSIGs.

  **rrsig-refresh** *seconds*
    How long before RRSIG expiration it will be refreshed.

  **nsec3** *enable*
    Specifies if NSEC3 will be used instead of NSEC.
    **Note**, currently unused (the setting is derived from NSEC3PARAM presence
    in the zone).

  **soa-min-ttl** *seconds*
    SOA Minimum TTL field.
    **Note**, Knot DNS overwrites the value with the real used value.

  **zone-max-ttl** *seconds*
    Max TTL in the zone.
    **Note**, Knot DNS will determine the value automatically in the future.

  **delay** *secones*
    Zone signing and data propagation delay. The value is added for safety to
    timing of all rollover steps.

keystore commands
.................

The key store functionality is limited at the moment. Only one instance of
file-based key store is supported. This command is subject to change.

**keystore** **list**
  List private keys in the key store.

Examples
--------

1. Initialize new KASP database, add a policy named *default* with default
   parameters, and add a zone *example.com*. The zone will use the created
   policy::

   $ keymgr init
   $ keymgr policy add default
   $ keymgr zone add example.com policy default

2. List zones containing *.com* substring::

   $ keymgr zone list .com

3. Add a testing policy *lab* with rapid key rollovers. Apply the policy to an
   existing zone::

   $ keymgr policy add lab rrsig-lifetime 300 rrsig-refresh 150 zsk-lifetime 600 delay 10
   $ keymgr zone set example.com policy lab

4. Add an existing and already secured zone. Let the keys be managed by the
   KASP. Make sure to import all used keys. Also the used algorithm must match
   with the one configured in the policy::

   $ keymgr zone add example.com policy default
   $ keymgr zone key import example.com Kexample.com+010+12345.private
   $ keymgr zone key import example.com Kexample.com+010+67890.private

5. Disable automatic key management for a secured zone::

   $ keymgr zone set example.com policy none

6. Add a zone to be signed with manual key maintenance. Generate one ECDSA
   signing key. The Single-Type Signing scheme will be used::

   $ keymgr zone add example.com policy none
   $ keymgr zone key gen example.com algo 13 size 256

7. Add a zone to be signed with manual key maintenance. Generate two
   RSA-SHA-256 signing keys. The first key will be used as a KSK, the second
   one as a ZSK::

   $ keymgr zone add example.com policy none
   $ keymgr zone key generate example.com algorithm rsasha256 size 2048 ksk
   $ keymgr zone key generate example.com algorithm rsasha256 size 1024
