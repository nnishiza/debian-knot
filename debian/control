Description: authoritative domain name server
 Knot DNS is a fast, authoritative only, high performance, feature
 full and open source name server.
 .
 Knot DNS is developed by CZ.NIC Labs, the R&D department of .CZ
 registry and hence is well suited to run anything from the root
 zone, the top-level domain, to many smaller standard domain names.
 .
 Note: this release is still EXPERIMENTAL and you should know what
 you are doing and be able to write bug reports.
